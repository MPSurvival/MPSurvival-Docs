# ðŸš€ How to create an equipment item ?

The process to create an equipment item is basically the same as creating a regular item   
(see [How to create an item?](../items/item_creation.md)).

### Key differences for equipment items

When creating an equipment item, make sure to properly set and configure the fields related to equipment:

- Configure the `Equippable Type` field accordingly.
- Fill in cosmetic fields such as `Cosmetic Static Mesh`, `Cosmetic Skeletal Mesh`, and `Cosmetic Socket` to define visuals.
- Add any relevant `Equipment Modifiers` for stats like armor, resistances, or special effects.
- Set the `Slot Types` field correctly to ensure the item appears in the appropriate slot.
- Make sure the `Equip Sound` and related fields are set for immersive feedback.

By tweaking these fields, your item will function as proper wearable equipment in the game.

!!! tip  
    Always test equipment items in multiplayer to verify proper equipping, visuals, and stat modifications.
