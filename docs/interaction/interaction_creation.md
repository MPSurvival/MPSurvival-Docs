|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `OnObjectSpawn`   | Custom spawn call â€” not called automatically at BeginPlay, call it yourself if needed |
| `OnPlayerStopHover` | Triggered when the player stops hovering over the object |
| `OnPlayerHover`   | Triggered when the player starts hovering over the object |
| `OnPlayerInteract`| Triggered when the player interacts with the object    |
